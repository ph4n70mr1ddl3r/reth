# Binaries

[**Archives of precompiled binaries of reth are available for Windows, macOS and Linux.**](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases) They are static executables. Users of platforms not explicitly listed below should download one of these archives.

If you use **macOS Homebrew** or **Linuxbrew**, you can install Reth from Paradigm's homebrew tap:

```text
brew install paradigmxyz/brew/reth
```

If you use **Arch Linux** you can install stable Reth from the AUR using an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers) ([paru][paru] as an example here):

```text
paru -S reth # Stable
paru -S reth-git # Unstable (git)
```
